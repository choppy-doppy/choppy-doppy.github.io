    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>nothing more than just your typical high school student, not much that's interesting about me, but I've always been
        interested in computer science and programming and everything in the realm of software since I was a little
        kid.</p>
    <p>im not entirely sure what I will do with this site, but for now I'm using it as an alternative to google docs, so
        I can submit my progress with learning stuff for my comp sci class without having to lose access to the document
        every time I submit it and therefore, having to make a new document weekly.</p>
