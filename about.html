            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>nothing more than just your typical highschool student, not much that's interesting about me but i've always been interested in computer science and programming and everything in the realm of software since i was a little kid.</p>
            <p>im not entirely sure what i will do with this site, but for now i'm using it as an alternative to google docs, so i can submit my progress with learning rust for my comp sci class without having to lose access to the document every time i submit it and therefore, having to make a new document weekly.</p>
